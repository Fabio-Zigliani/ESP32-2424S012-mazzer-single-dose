# List of Hardware components to deliver project.
## The Grinder
- A working Mazzer Grinder (This is what I used and a purchased one that was not working because the time switch had failed; I do not need the timer switch so I got it cheap)
## The Funnel
- I purchased this [Stainless Steel Dispensing Funnel](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006103829888.html "Stainless Steel Dispensing Funnel") in the 13cm diameter version and removed the Handle and shortened the bottom.
